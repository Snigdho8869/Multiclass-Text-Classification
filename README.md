# Multiclass Text Classification with Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This repository contains code for implementing various machine learning and deep learning models for multiclass text classification. The models implemented in this repository include support vector machines(SVM), Multinominal naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forests, ensembled learning, adaboost, gradientboosting, convolutional neural networks(CNN), and recurrent neural networks(RNN) an gted recurrent unit(GRU).

# Requirements:

* Python 

* Scikit-learn

* TensorFlow 

* Keras
